                                        Huangmei Opera originated as a form of rural folksong and dance that has been in existence for the last 200 years and possibly longer.
                                        The original Huangmei opera was sung by women when they were picking tea,
                                        thus was called the Picking Tea Song. In the late Qing dynasty,
                                        the songs came into Anhui Province and gradually developed into a newborn's operas. <br>
                                        Huangmei means yellow plum flowers.
